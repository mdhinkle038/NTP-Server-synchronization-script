# NTP-Server-synchronization-script
Set up an NTP server on your student VMs, and write a script that checks NTP synchronization.

Students will set up NTPd on their VMs to point to time.nist.gov and pool.ntp.org.
Students will also write a script that ensures the VM is synchronized with both NTP servers, that time is accurate to within one second, and will dump information about these two things in the server logs.
